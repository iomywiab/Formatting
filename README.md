# Formatting

PHP Composer library for value formatting.

## Quickstart

There are several formatters in this library. I guess the main features are:

* Value formatters: pretty printing of single values, or printing with additional debug info like types of array items
* Messages: building print messages 
* TemplateReplacer: substitutes content in messages, fast on multiple usages such as logging

Please check the [example](./tests/Examples/ExampleTest.php).
